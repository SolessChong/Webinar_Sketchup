So here's what we need to do:

 - create a basic handler to render the room
   - write the python pieces
   - write some html/css
   - write the javascript pieces
     - a roster handler
     - a transcript handler
     - an input handler
 - model the transcript
 - model the people who are viewing the room
 - broadcast data
 - handle input
 - handle presence
